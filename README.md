# TTCLines

### TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) map view for surface route vehicle tracking and estimated next departure times app for Android

#### Major features include:
- map view centered on user location showing all nearby surface route stops
- click on stops in map view to open popup showing estimated next vehicle arrival times
- track vehicles as they move across their routes

## Project Status

Unfortunately, due to life events, I haven't been able to update TTCLines much recently.  So I've decided to open source the entire project in hopes that others will be able to help contribute.  
### How Can I Help?
I'm sure the app code could use some updates, and some beautifying. Feel free to contribute by updating the app code itself.  Pull requests are welcome :).
